## Hi


What I'm doing right now:
Learning MySQL db

Making a custom CDN thing where I use my redundant servers for something useful.

Rest apis using Spring

Will start learning Rust, after that I'm going try making sort of a all-purposes one click deployment web ui thingy.

I'm also on Discord: AltDel#1762
